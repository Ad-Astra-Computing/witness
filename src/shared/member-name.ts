/**
 * Escaped-member-name detection for signed INK bodies.
 *
 * V8 returns a wrong property key from `JSON.parse` when an object member name
 * is written with an escape sequence. `GetKeyChars` in V8's JSON parser builds a
 * character span from a pointer into the raw source text but sizes it with the
 * decoded length, and the hidden-class transition matcher then compares that
 * oversized-source/undersized-length span against an existing transition name.
 * On a match the transition's name is reused as the property key without ever
 * decoding the escape, so `{"x":{"\\":1},"y":{"\n":2}}` yields a `y` whose only
 * member is named `\`, not a newline. The wrong key is a real property, so
 * `JSON.stringify` and therefore JCS serialize it.
 *
 * The defect requires the member name's raw spelling to be longer than its
 * decoded value, which requires an escape. Banning escaped member names in
 * signed bodies removes the precondition entirely, whatever transitions the
 * runtime happens to hold. That matters because the runtimes affected are the
 * ones INK targets: Node 24 and newer, and Cloudflare workerd, where the
 * corruption is unconditional and a poisoned transition persists across
 * requests within an isolate. Go's `encoding/json` is unaffected, so without
 * this rule a Go receiver and a workerd receiver reach different verdicts on
 * the same signed bytes.
 *
 * A receiver rejects an escaped member name on the raw JSON text before
 * parsing; a signer rejects the corresponding object keys before
 * canonicalization. See `the INK signed-string-safety spec` §5.

/**
 * Whether raw JSON text contains an object member name written with any escape
 * sequence. Operates on the raw text rather than the parsed value, because by
 * the time the value exists the wrong key has already replaced the right one.
 *
 * A string is a member name exactly when the next non-whitespace character
 * after its closing quote is `:`, which is precise for well-formed JSON. Text
 * this misreads is malformed and fails the subsequent `JSON.parse`, so a
 * misread cannot admit a body. The scan never decodes an escape: it only tracks
 * whether one occurred, so it is not a second parser on the signing path.
